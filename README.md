Hi it's Tanjil, on this Github I will just share my coding journey.
I aspire to become a software developer involved in producing cutting edge technology.
So far I am self taught but I want to join a team whom I can collaborate with and learn from
Follow me on my journey and let us see the projects I will be working on in 1/2 years compared to now.
Currently I am focused on solidifying fundementals.

(I do have a hobbie, game development using C# with Unity. You may see some of that!)
